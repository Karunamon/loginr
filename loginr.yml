# OPTIONS
#
# die_on_error: Bail out if there are any errors that look like
#               network issues. Defaults to false.

# user_agent: Browser user agent that the script will use. FOR YOUR
#             OWN SAFETY, you should set this to match the browser

#             program will exit immediately if this option is not set.
#             If you're not sure what your user agent is, go to
#             http://whatismybrowser.com and look on the bottom
#             of the page. Paste the resulting text.
